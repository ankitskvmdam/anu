                accurately predicting protein-protein interaction (PPI) binding sites is a fundamental problem.
                Experimental methods are slow and expensive. Therefore, great efforts are being made towards increasing
                the performance of computational methods.Results We propose DELPHI (DEep Learning Prediction of Highly
                probable protein Interaction sites), a new sequence-based deep learning suite for PPI binding sites
                prediction. DELPHI has an ensemble structure with data augmentation and it employs novel features in

    abstract = "{Sequence-based protein–protein interaction (PPI) prediction represents a fundamental computational
                biology problem. To address this problem, extensive research efforts have been made to extract predefined
                features from the sequences. Based on these features, statistical algorithms are learned to classify the
                PPIs. However, such explicit features are usually costly to extract, and typically have limited coverage
                on the PPI information.We present an end-to-end framework, PIPR (Protein–Protein Interaction Prediction
                Based on Siamese Residual RCNN), for PPI predictions using only the protein sequences. PIPR incorporates
                a deep residual recurrent convolutional neural network in the Siamese architecture, which leverages both
                robust local features and contextualized information, which are significant for capturing the mutual
                influence of proteins sequences. PIPR relieves the data pre-processing efforts that are required by other
                systems, and generalizes well to different application scenarios. Experimental evaluations show that PIPR
                outperforms various state-of-the-art systems on the binary PPI prediction problem. Moreover, it shows a
                promising performance on more challenging problems of interaction type prediction and binding affinity

                of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), understanding these is therefore crucial in the investigation of
                biological systems. Despite all past efforts, we still lack high-quality PPI data for constructing the
                networks, which makes it challenging to study the functions of association of proteins. High-throughput
                experimental techniques have produced abundant data for systematically studying the cellular networks of
                a biological system and the development of computational method for PPI identification.Results We have
                developed a deep learning-based framework, named iPPI, for accurately predicting PPI on a proteome-wide
                scale depended only on sequence information. iPPI integrates the amino acid properties and compositions
                of protein sequence into a unified prediction framework using a hybrid deep neural network. Extensive
                tests demonstrated that iPPI can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art prediction methods in
                identifying PPIs. In addition, the iPPI prediction score can be related to the strength of

    abstract = "{The functional impact of protein mutations is reflected on the alteration of conformation and
                thermodynamics of protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Quantifying the changes of two interacting
                proteins upon mutations is commonly carried out by computational approaches. Hence, extensive research
                efforts have been put to the extraction of energetic or structural features on proteins, followed by
                statistical learning methods to estimate the effects of mutations on PPI properties. Nonetheless, such
                features require extensive human labors and expert knowledge to obtain, and have limited abilities to
                reflect point mutations. We present an end-to-end deep learning framework, MuPIPR (Mutation Effects in
                Protein–protein Interaction PRediction Using Contextualized Representations), to estimate the effects of
                mutations on PPIs. MuPIPR incorporates a contextualized representation mechanism of amino acids to
                propagate the effects of a point mutation to surrounding amino acid representations, therefore amplifying
                the subtle change in a long protein sequence. On top of that, MuPIPR leverages a Siamese residual
                recurrent convolutional neural encoder to encode a wild-type protein pair and its mutation pair.
                Multi-layer perceptron regressors are applied to the protein pair representations to predict the

                binding affinity for SKEMPI v1, and offers comparable performance on SKEMPI v2. Meanwhile, MuPIPR also
