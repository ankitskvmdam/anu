Anu is a tool that helps in predicting the interaction between given
two proteins, protein and DNA or protein and RNA. \\
Experimental methods for finding the interaction between protein-protein
is slow and expensive. The functionality of proteins usually depend on their
interaction with other protein, which is why accurately predicting protein
-protein interaction (PPI) is very important. \\
With the advancement in technology and an increase in the size of protein
interacting and non-interacting databases, we can use machine learning
techniques to identify whether a protein will interact with other protein
or not. \\
Currently, Anu is only able to predict the interaction between given
two proteins. Interaction between Protein-DNA and Protein-RNA is not
implemented. \\
