In any machine learning project, the majority of researcher's time (around 80 to 90\%) is spent on dealing with data.
Anu reduces this time to almost negligible.
Users can reply on Anu's data pre processing pipeline for all their data needs and focus on algorithm implementations.
This can potentially increase researcher's productivity many times.
